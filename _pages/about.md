# 🌟 Bio

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

In Spring 2023, I joined Prof. Tianyi Zhang's group at Purdue University to study code generation and evaluation. I also worked on an HCI project with a Ph.D. student, Wei-Hao Chen. In Fall 2024, I worked with Prof. Lingming Zhang at UIUC to study automated program repair.

My current research focuses on advancing large language models in Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction by enhancing both their reliability and human interaction capabilities. Specifically, I apply an LLM-based method to reliably evaluate code generation and develop a system that helps users create data wrangling scripts through interactive operations. By developing tools to make AI reliable and user-friendly, I hope to make advanced programming capabilities accessible to a broader audience.

You can find my CV [here](cv/Weixi-CV.pdf).

> 🎓 Weixi is actively seeking Ph.D. positions starting in Fall 2025.
