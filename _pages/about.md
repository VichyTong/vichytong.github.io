# 🌟 Bio

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

In Spring 2023, I joined Prof. Tianyi Zhang's lab at Purdue University to study code generation and evaluation. I also collaborated on an HCI project with a Ph.D. student, Wei-Hao Chen. In Fall 2024, I worked with Prof. Lingming Zhang at UIUC on automated program repair.

My research interest lies in how to better leverage LLMs to generate code. Standing at the intersection of SE, HCI, and AI, I want to build reliable and helpful code generation systems for users. Specifically, I have three main research goals: 

- developing trustworthy evaluation methods for code generation

- detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM-generated code

- designing user-friendly interfaces and novel interaction techniques to help users with different backgrounds use code generation tools.

> 🎓 Weixi is actively seeking Ph.D. positions starting in Fall 2025.
