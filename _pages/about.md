# 🌟 Bio

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

During my sophomore year, I collaborated with Prof. Jianzhu Ma at Peking University. In my junior year, I was advised by Prof. Tianyi Zhang at Purdue University. Currently, I am working with Prof. Lingming Zhang at UIUC. I feel honored to have the opportunity to work with such great professors! My research interests lie in advancing the development of **robust**, **efficient**, and **impactful AI systems**, particularly in **software engineering** (AI systems for programming) and **human-computer interaction** (human-centered AI systems).

> 🎓 I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions starting in Fall 2025. Please feel free to contact me at [weixitong@hust.edu.cn](weixitong@hust.edu.cn).
